                            Today, several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa contine to face similar threats from armed 
                            conflicts between rebel forces, terrorist groups and militant groups, and are known to be 
                            some of the most dangerous places to be in the world, to grow up as a child. (Save our Children, 2021)

                            Since the start of its civil war in 2013, South Sudan has seen more than 2.4 million

                            The raging violence today, is a dire reflection of past events. We have already seen that civil wars 
                            and mass displacement hurt children the most.
